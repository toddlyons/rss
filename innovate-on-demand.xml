<description>How do you hire the right person for the job? In our federal public service, the conventional method demands that applicants use a rigid format, using specific keywords to map their education, skills and experience onto a defined list of essential and merit criteria. Canada's Free Agents went another way, assessing applicants against a set of behavioural characteristics, to great success. Our guest this episode says that whatever process we try to implement, in the end, it all comes down to first impressions.

<description>A Surge Team is a group of employees with no ongoing files. Instead, they exist to tackle priority initiatives identified by Deputy Ministers and other senior government officials. The assignments are time sensitive, complex and innovative, and as such, depend on employees suited to this type of dynamic work. But how do you find the right people to perform in an environment of frequent change?

<description>Telework remains a contentious issue in the public service. Some groups use it extensively. Others grant it only in extreme circumstances and for limited periods of time, requiring proof of need in order to prolong the arrangement, because after all, how can you manage people you can't see?
